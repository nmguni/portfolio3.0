            Iâ€™m a Web Dev based in Ontario and I have been developing for 3.5, I
            pride myself on coding clean, semantic HTML, and having strong
            attention to detail. It is very important to ensure a website meets
            the design requirements, and the site functions across all major
            browsers. I am also a strong proponent of responsive design, as it
            ensures a website will adapt to all devices and browsers. Outside of
            developing websites, I enjoy reading (currently reading ghost wars
            the secret history of the CIA) , The gym, and watching sports with
            friends.
