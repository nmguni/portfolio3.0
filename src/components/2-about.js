            Hi, my name is Ndumiso Mguni and I am a Web Developer. I have been
            developing for 3 years now and I have a little over a year and a
            half of professional experience. I worked at Ontario SEO as a Web
            developer. It's a small company so we only had two developers
            including myself. I worked with technologies that I have never
            worked with before, as a result, I was learning something new every
            single day and I loved it!
          </p>

            {" "}
            Iâ€™m currently working to become more proficient with JavaScript,
            along with dipping my toe into the back end to work with Node.js and
            MongoDB. Outside of developing websites, I enjoy spending time
            reading, watching sports, the gym, and spending time with family and
            friends.
